# Nodemon

Nodemon starts a node server locally and makes testing JS code much easier. 

Simply clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/louwjlabuschagne/nodemon.git
```

`cd` into the directory

```
cd nodemon
```


Intall the dependencies 

```
npm install
```

Start the server

```
npm run start
```

Any edits made to `index.js` will reflect in the console.
